## Project Overview In this project, I performed an extensive data analysis on financial and investment data using advanced MS Excel techniques for data wrangling and mining. The datasets were sourced from the real time data 
## Objectives - To analyze financial and investment data from the census to identify key trends and insights. - To create interactive dashboards that visualize the data and make it accessible for stakeholders. 
## Data Sources - **Financial Data Sheet**: This dataset contains various financial metrics from the census data, including the following headers: - Gender - Age - Investment Avenues - Mutual Funds - Equity Market - Debentures - Government Bonds - Fixed Deposits - PPF - Gold - Stock Market - Factor - Objective - Purpose - Duration - Invest Monitor - Expect - Avenue - What are your savings objectives? - Reason Equity - Reason Mutual - Reason Bonds - Reason FD - Source - Average Expectancy - Investment Amount - Invested Amount - Avenue - Base Amount - **Investment Data Sheet**: This dataset includes information about investment types, amounts, returns, and demographics of investors, with the following headers: - Gender - AGE - Do you invest in Investment Avenues? - Mutual Funds Rank - Equity Market Rank - Debentures Rank - Government Bonds Rank - Fixed Deposits Rank - Public Provident Fund Rank - Gold Rank - Do you invest in Stock Market? - Factors considered while investing - Investment objective? - Purpose behind investment? - Investment Duration - Average investment Duration - Investment Frequency - Investment Return - Preferred Investment - Savings Objectives - Reasons for investing in Equity Market - Reasons for investing in Mutual Funds - Reasons for investing in Government Bonds - Reasons for investing in Fixed Deposits - Average Expected Return - Sources of information for investments - Age Group - Average Rank Score - Invester Type - Return Expectation 
## Tools and Techniques - **Advanced MS Excel**: Utilized for data cleaning, wrangling, and mining. - **Pivot Tables and Charts**: To summarize and visualize the data efficiently. - **VLOOKUP and INDEX/MATCH**: For data consolidation and ensuring accuracy in analyses. - **Conditional Formatting**: To highlight key trends and outliers in the data. - **Dashboard Creation**: Developed two separate, interactive dashboards for financial and investment data using Excelâ€™s advanced visualization tools. 
## Methodology 1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed inconsistencies, handled missing values, and standardized data formats to ensure the datasets were ready for analysis. 2. **Data Wrangling**: Merged and transformed the data using advanced Excel functions to create a unified dataset for analysis. 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted EDA to uncover initial insights and identify patterns within the datasets. 4. **Dashboard Development**: Designed interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics, trends, and insights for financial and investment data. 
## Key Findings - Identified significant trends in income and expenditure across different demographics. - Analyzed investment patterns and returns to provide actionable insights for investors. - Highlighted areas of financial concern, such as high debt levels in certain demographics. 
## Impact - The interactive dashboards provide a comprehensive view of financial and investment data, facilitating data-driven decision-making.
