Welcome to my GitHub portfolio—where Excel isn't just spreadsheets, it's strategy. Across each project, I’ve executed the full analytical workflow: from raw data to refined dashboards that drive decisions.


**PO & Shipment Tracker:** Optimized supply chain oversight using Excel dashboards to monitor purchase orders and shipment statuses. Enhanced visibility led to smarter inventory control.

**Smart Investment Decisions:** Leveraged financial datasets to assess portfolio performance and forecast returns. Used Excel charts and formulas to empower investment choices.

**Zomato CraveMate:** Analyzed food ordering patterns and customer reviews. Built a dashboard to visualize restaurant ratings and consumer behavior for strategic dining insights.

**Jewellery Merchandising Project:** Mapped product trends and seasonal demand using Excel pivot tables and visualizations. Delivered a merchandising strategy dashboard for sales and inventory alignment.


Every dashboard is crafted to convert complex data into clear decisions—Excel is my canvas, insight is the art.
